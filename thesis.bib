abstract = {PURPOSE: A newly developed head-mounted perimeter termed "imo" enables visual field (VF) testing without a fixed head position. Because the positional relationship between the subject's head and the imo is fixed, the effects of head position changes on the test results are small compared with those obtained using a stationary perimeter. However, only ocular counter-roll (OCR) induced by head tilt might affect VF testing. To quantitatively reveal the effects of head tilt and OCR on the VF test results, we investigated the associations among the head-tilt angle, OCR amplitude and VF testing results. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For 20 healthy subjects, we binocularly recorded static OCR (s-OCR) while tilting the subject's head at an arbitrary angle ranging from 0 degrees to 60 degrees rightward or leftward in 10 degrees increments. By monitoring iris patterns, we evaluated the s-OCR amplitude. We also performed blind spot detection while tilting the subject's head by an arbitrary angle ranging from 0 degrees to 50 degrees rightward or leftward in 10 degrees increments to calculate the angle by which the blind spot rotates because of head tilt. RESULTS: The association between s-OCR amplitude and head-tilt angle showed a sinusoidal relationship. In blind spot detection, the blind spot rotated to the opposite direction of the head tilt, and the association between the rotation angle of the blind spot and the head-tilt angle also showed a sinusoidal relationship. The rotation angle of the blind spot was strongly correlated with the s-OCR amplitude (R2{\textgreater}/=0.94, p{\textless}0.0001). A head tilt greater than 20 degrees with imo causes interference between adjacent test areas. CONCLUSIONS: Both the s-OCR amplitude and the rotation angle of the blind spot were correlated with the head-tilt angle by sinusoidal regression. The rotated VF was correlated with the s-OCR amplitude. During perimetry using imo, the change in the subject's head tilt should be limited to 20 degrees .},

abstract = {This paper highlights the role that reinforcement learning can play in the optimization of treatment policies for chronic illnesses. Before applying any off-the-shelf reinforcement learning methods in this setting, we must first tackle a number of challenges. We outline some of these challenges and present methods for overcoming them. First, we describe a multiple imputation approach to overcome the problem of missing data. Second, we discuss the use of function approximation in the context of a highly variable observation set. Finally, we discuss approaches to summarizing the evidence in the data for recommending a particular action and quantifying the uncertainty around the Q-function of the recommended policy. We present the results of applying these methods to real clinical trial data of patients with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {We develop reinforcement learning trials for discovering individualized treatment regimens for life- threatening diseases such as cancer. A temporal-difference learning method called Q-learning is utilized that involves learning an optimal policy from a single training set of finite longitudinal patient trajectories. Approximating the Q-function with time-indexed parameters can be achieved by using support vector regression or extremely randomized trees. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the procedure can extract optimal strategies directly from clinical data without relying on the identification of any accurate mathematical models, unlike approaches based on adaptive design. We show that reinforcement learning has tremendous potential in clinical research because it can select actions that improve outcomes by taking into account delayed effects even when the relationship between actions and outcomes is not fully known. To support our claims, the methodology's practical utility is illustrated in a simulation analysis. In the immediate future, we will apply this general strategy to studying and identifying new treatments for advanced metastatic stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer, which usually includes multiple lines of chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, there is significant potential of the proposed methodology for devel- oping personalized treatment strategies in other cancers, in cystic fibrosis, and in other life-threatening diseases.

abstract = {Typical regimens for advanced metastatic stage IIIB/IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consist of multiple lines of treatment. We present an adaptive reinforcement learning approach to discover optimal individualized treatment regimens from a specially designed clinical trial (a "clinical reinforcement trial") of an experimental treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC who have not been treated previously with systemic therapy. In addition to the complexity of the problem of selecting optimal compounds for first- and second-line treatments based on prognostic factors, another primary goal is to determine the optimal time to initiate second-line therapy, either immediately or delayed after induction therapy, yielding the longest overall survival time. A reinforcement learning method called Q-learning is utilized, which involves learning an optimal regimen from patient data generated from the clinical reinforcement trial. Approximating the Q-function with time-indexed parameters can be achieved by using a modification of support vector regression that can utilize censored data. Within this framework, a simulation study shows that the procedure can extract optimal regimens for two lines of treatment directly from clinical data without prior knowledge of the treatment effect mechanism. In addition, we demonstrate that the design reliably selects the best initial time for second-line therapy while taking into account the heterogeneity of NSCLC across patients.},

abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess whether the combined use of both structural and functional tests improves discrimination between healthy and glaucomatous eyes over either type of testing alone. Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Participants: One hundred twenty-three eyes of 123 participants enrolled in the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study. Methods: Because both structural and functional tests were evaluated, 2 definitions of glaucoma were used: glaucomatous visual field (VF) damage based on repeatable abnormal standard automated perimetry results (n = 43) and glaucomatous optic disc (glaucomatous optic neuropathy [GON]) based on masked assessment of optic disc stereophotographs (n = 65). Participants had scanning laser polarimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy imaging in addition to frequency-doubling technology (FDT) perimetry and short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) testing completed within a 6-month interval. Main Outcome Measures: For each glaucoma definition, sensitivities and specificities were calculated for the best structural parameters, FDT perimetry pattern standard deviation (PSD), and SWAP PSD/glaucoma hemifield test, and then for each possible pairwise combination of one structural and one functional parameter. Results: The best structural parameters for discriminating between glaucoma and control eyes were nerve fiber indicator for scanning laser polarimetry, inferior average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness for OCT, and Moorfields regression classification for confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Sensitivities and specificities for detecting glaucomatous VF damage for scanning laser polarimetry, OCT, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, FDT perimetry, and SWAP were 41.9{\%} and 98.3{\%}, 58.1{\%} and 98.3{\%}, 58.1{\%} and 84.5{\%}, 44.2{\%} and 98.3{\%}, and 65.1{\%} and 86.2{\%}, respectively. Adding FDT perimetry to each of the best structural parameters led to a significant (P{\textless}0.05) increase in sensitivity without a significant change in specificity compared with structural parameters alone. Adding SWAP to each of the best structural parameters led to a significant increase in sensitivity and also a significant decrease in specificity compared with each structural parameter alone. Conclusions: A combination of parameters from structural tests and functional tests can improve the sensitivity of glaucoma detection. The sensitivity and specificity desired for a particular clinical application will determine the selection of the particular diagnostic tests. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Academy of Ophthalmology.},

abstract = {Purpose: To identify the best combination of Stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness parameters for the detection of glaucoma. Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Participants: Eighty-nine age-matched normal and perimetric glaucoma participants enrolled in the Advanced Imaging for Glaucoma Study. Methods: The Zeiss Stratus OCT system was used to obtain the circumpapillary RNFL thickness in both eyes of each participant. Right and left eye clock-hour data are analyzed together, assuming mirror-image symmetry. The RNFL diagnostic parameters were combined using either or-logic or and-logic approaches. Main Outcome Measures: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC), sensitivity, and specificity are used to evaluate diagnostic performance. Results: Overall average RNFL thickness has the highest AROC value (0.89) of all single parameters evaluated, followed by the inferior and superior quadrants (0.88 and 0.86, respectively). The clock hours with the best AROC values are in the inferior and superior quadrants. The highest AROC (0.92) was achieved by the or-logic combination of overall, inferior, and superior quadrant RNFL thicknesses. The 3-parameter combination was significantly better than the overall average alone (P = 0.01). The addition of more quadrants or clock hours to the combination reduced diagnostic performance. Conclusions: The best stand-alone diagnostic strategy for Stratus OCT RNFL data is to classify an eye as glaucomatous if the overall, inferior quadrant, or superior quadrant RNFL thickness average is below normal. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Academy of Ophthalmology.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. To assess the impact of a novel visual field spatial filtering technique on the detection of glaucomatous progression. METHODS. One hundred ninety-eight ocular hypertensive (OHT) and 21 control subjects were examined prospectively (1994-2001) with regular full-threshold Humphrey visual field (VF) testing. VF progression was assessed by point-wise linear regression (PLR) of sensitivity/time in Progressor for Windows software modified to include a novel spatial filter. Standard progression criteria (slope 1 dB/year, P 0.01) were applied to both "raw" (unfiltered) and "filtered" VF series. Three-omitting confirmatory VF criteria were also applied to unfiltered VF series. Specificity was estimated as the proportion of progressing control subjects and as the proportion of significantly improving subjects (both OHT and control) at the end of the study period. RESULTS. Applying standard PLR, specificity was estimated at 91.8{\%} to 97.5{\%} using unfiltered standard PLR, compared with 93.5{\%} to 98.4{\%} using filtered standard PLR and 95.4{\%} to 99.3{\%} using unfiltered three-omitting PLR. The rate of identified VF progression in the OHT cohort was 32.3{\%} with unfiltered standard PLR, 28.7{\%} with filtered standard PLR, and 18.6{\%} with unfiltered three-omitting PLR. There was no significant difference in time to detected progression between filtered and unfiltered standard PLR. CONCLUSIONS. The use of confirmatory tests resulted in improved specificity using unfiltered data; however, application of the spatial filter resulted in similar specificity but with a higher rate of detected progression. This filter may therefore be useful in the monitoring of glaucomatous progression as it may reduce the dependence on confirmatory testing, although it has yet to be applied to longitudinal SITA data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate a method for visual field (VF) progression analysis, called ANSWERS (Analysis with Non-Stationary Weibull Error Regression and Spatial Enhancement), which takes into account increasing measurement variability as glaucoma progresses and spatial correlation among test locations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: ANSWERS outputs both a global index of progression and a pointwise estimate of rate of change at each VF location. ANSWERS was compared with linear regression of mean deviation (MD) and permutation of pointwise linear regression (PoPLR). Visual field series of up to 2 years from the United Kingdom Glaucoma Treatment Study were used. This consists of 9104 Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm Standard 24-2 VFs. ANSWERS and PoPLR rate of change were used to predict the VF at the next visit using subseries that were within 7, 13, 18, or 22 months from the baseline. The comparison was carried out on the statistical sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of predicting future VF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Across all subseries, statistical sensitivity of ANSWERS in detecting VF deterioration was significantly better than the linear regression of MD and PoPLR, especially in short time series. Prediction accuracy of ANSWERS was better than PoPLR at all series lengths, and the improvement was particularly marked in shorter series. Seventy-five percent of VF series were better predicted by ANSWERS compared with PoPLR. The average prediction error of ANSWERS was 15{\%} lower than that of PoPLR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: ANSWERS is more sensitive to detect VF progression and predicts future VF loss better than linear regression of MD and PoPLR, especially over short observation periods.

abstract = {Objective: To investigate pointwise linear regression (PLR) for longitudinal evaluation of visual fields and to compare results with those of the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) criteria. Methods: We selected 509 eyes (401 patients) from the AGIS with 3 or more years of follow-up, 7 or more visual field examinations, and an AGIS reference score of 16 or lower. Visual field change at test locations was defined as a change of threshold sensitivity of 1 dB/y or higher and P.01. Several sets of criteria were investigated for defining change of visual field series with PLR. Main Outcome Measures: Progression or improvement of visual field series with PLR and AGIS criteria. Results: Mean (SD) follow-up time and baseline AGIS score were 7.4 (1.7) years and 7.7 (4.4), respectively. Pair-wise agreement between AGIS and various PLR criteria ranged from 52{\%} to 64{\%} with the statistic varying between 0.22 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.15-0.29) and 0.30 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.22-0.38). One hundred thirty-eight (27{\%}) and 151 (30{\%}) eyes progressed (85 eyes or 17{\%} detected by both methods) while 72 (14{\%}) and 11 (2{\%}) eyes improved (5 eyes or 1{\%} detected by both methods) based on AGIS and the most rigorous PLR criteria, respectively. Conclusions: Based on rigorous, clinically relevant criteria , PLR detects progression in a similar proportion of eyes compared with AGIS criteria. Pointwise linear regression may be superior to AGIS methods since it identifies fewer visual field series as improving.},

Region-wise indices sit in between. This study introduces a machine learning–based index for glaucoma progression detection that outperforms global, region-wise, and point-wise indices. Design: Development and comparison of a prognostic index. Method: Visual fields from 2085 eyes of 1214 subjects were used to identify glaucoma progression patterns using machine learning. Visual fields from 133 eyes of 71 glaucoma patients were collected 10 times over 10 weeks to provide a no-change, test-retest dataset. The parameters of all methods were identified using visual field sequences in the test-retest dataset to meet fixed 95{\%} specificity. An independent dataset of 270 eyes of 136 glaucoma patients and survival analysis were used to compare methods. Results: The time to detect progression in 25{\%} of the eyes in the longitudinal dataset using global mean deviation (MD) was 5.2 (95{\%} confidence interval, 4.1–6.5) years; 4.5 (4.0–5.5) years using region-wise, 3.9 (3.5–4.6) years using point-wise, and 3.5 (3.1–4.0) years using machine learning analysis. The time until 25{\%} of eyes showed subsequently confirmed progression after 2 additional visits were included were 6.6 (5.6–7.4) years, 5.7 (4.8–6.7) years, 5.6 (4.7–6.5) years, and 5.1 (4.5–6.0) years for global, region-wise, point-wise, and machine learning analyses, respectively. Conclusions: Machine learning analysis detects progressing eyes earlier than other methods consistently, with or without confirmation visits. In particular, machine learning detects more slowly progressing eyes than other methods.},

Empirical data were used to obtain variability estimates of MD while statistical modelling techniques derived the required time periods to detect change with various degrees of visual field variability. We provide the frequency of examinations per year required to detect different amounts of change in 2, 3 and 5 years. For instance, three examinations per year are required to identify an overall change in MD of 4 dB over 2 years in a patient with average visual field variability.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the ability of pointwise linear, exponential, and logistic functions, and combinations of functions, to model the longitudinal behavior of visual field (VF) series and predict future VF loss in patients with glaucoma.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Visual field series from 782 eyes (572 patients) with open-angle glaucoma had greater than 6 years of follow-up and 12 VFs performed. Threshold sensitivities from the first 5 years at each location were regressed with linear, exponential, and logistic functions to estimate model parameters. A multiple-model approach applied the model with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) at each location as the preferred model for future predictions. Predictions for each model were compared at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years after the last VF used to determine model parameters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were no clinically important differences between any of the models tested for fit; however, the logistic function had the lowest average RMSE (P {\textless} 0.001). For predictions, the exponential model consistently had the lowest average prediction RMSE for all time intervals (P {\textless} 0.001); the multiple-model approach did not perform better than the exponential model (P {\textless} 0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: While the logistic model best fit glaucomatous VF behavior over a long time period, the exponential model provided the best average predictions. A multiple-model approach for VF predictions was associated with a greater prediction error than with the best-performing single-model approach. A model's goodness of fit is not indicative of its predictive ability for measurements of glaucomatous VFs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of statistical modelling techniques to identify models that both describe glaucomatous sensitivity decay and allow predictions of future field status.$\backslash$nMETHOD: Twelve initially normal fellow eyes of untreated patients with confirmed normal tension glaucoma were studied. All had in excess of 15 Humphrey fields (mean follow-up 5.7 years). From this cohort individual field locations were selected for analysis if they demonstrated unequivocal deterioration at the final two fields. Forty-seven locations from five eyes satisfied this criterion and were analysed using curve-fitting software which automatically applies 221 different models to sensitivity (y) against time of follow up (x). Curve-fitting was then repeated on the first five fields, followed by projection to the date of the final field to generate a predicted threshold which was compared to the actual threshold. Competing models were therefore assessed on their performance at adequately fitting the data (R2) and their potential to predict future field status.$\backslash$nRESULTS: Models that provide the best fit to the data were all complex polynomial expressions (median R2 0.93). Other simple expressions fitted fewer locations and exhibited lower R2 values. However, accuracy in predicting future deterioration was superior with these less complex models. In this group a linear expression demonstrated an adequate fit to the majority of the data and generated the most accurate predictions of future field status.$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A linear model of the pointwise sensitivity values against time of follow-up can provide a framework for detecting and forecasting glaucomatous field progression. Linear modelling allows the clinically important rate of sensitivity loss to be estimated.},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of the study was to compare event-based glaucoma progression analysis (GPA) I with new GPA II software and pattern deviation-based trend analyses (visual field index [VFI]) to detect progression in a glaucoma population. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included 90 eyes of 90 patients with a minimum of five reliable visual field tests and a follow-up period of at least 2 years. RESULTS: Event-based GPA II detected progression in 16.7{\%} of eyes in which trend analysis VFI failed. GPA detected progression 6.8 months earlier than VFI. GPA I and II showed excellent agreement (k = 0.94). Agreement between VFI and mean deviation (MD) linear analysis and with GPA criteria was k = 0.52 and k = 0.48, respectively. Mean rates of progression of MD and VFI were -0.41 dB and -1.30{\%} annually, respectively (rho = 0.824; p{\textless}0.0001). Using VFI, mean follow-up time was 6.12 and 4.89 years (p = 0.004) and the mean number of visual field tests was 7.33 and 6.01 (p = 0.023) in eyes with and without progression, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Event-based software GPA I and II had excellent agreement. Event analysis showed earlier and greater sensitivity for detecting progression than VFI analysis and both had only moderate agreement. Trend analysis VFI is likely to detect progression in patients with a greater number of visual field tests and a longer follow-up time. The VFI analysis seems to be more accurate than MD analysis for determining rate of progression.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess factors for progression in the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT), including the effect of EMGT treatment. Setting/Participants: Two hundred fifty-five open-angle glaucoma patients randomized to argon laser tra-beculoplasty plus topical betaxolol or no immediate treatment (129 treated; 126 controls) and followed up every 3 months. Methods: Progression was determined by perimetric and photographic optic disc criteria. Patient-based risk of progression was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression models and was expressed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI). Results: After 6 years, 53{\%} of patients progressed. In multivariate analyses, progression risk was halved by treatment (HR = 0.50; 95{\%} CI, 0.35-0.71). Predictive base-line factors were higher intraocular pressure (IOP) (ie, the higher the baseline IOP, the higher the risk), exfo-liation, and having both eyes eligible (each of the latter 2 factors doubled the risk), as well as worse mean deviation and older age. Progression risk decreased by about 10{\%} with each millimeter of mercury of IOP reduction from baseline to the first follow-up visit (HR=0.90 per millimeter of mercury decrease; 95{\%} CI, 0.86-0.94). The first IOP at that visit (3 months' follow-up) was also related to progression (HR = 1.11 per millimeter of mercury higher; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-1.17), as was the mean IOP at follow-up (HR=1.13 per millimeter of mercury higher; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.19). The percent of patient follow-up visits with disc hemorrhages was also related to progression (HR=1.02 per percent higher; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.03). No other factors were identified. Conclusions: Patients treated in the EMGT had half of the progression risk of control patients. The magnitude of initial IOP reduction was a major factor influencing outcome. Progression was also increased with higher base-line IOP, exfoliation, bilateral disease, worse mean deviation , and older age, as well as frequent disc hemorrhages during follow-up. Each higher (or lower) millimeter of mercury of IOP on follow-up was associated with an approximate 10{\%} increased (or decreased) risk of progression.},

abstract = {Primary open-angle glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and, perhaps, the most common form of glaucoma. Because the disease is treatable, and because the visual impairment caused by glaucoma is irreversible, early detection is essential. Early diagnosis depends on examination of the optic disc, retinal nerve fibre layer, and visual field. New imaging and psychophysical tests can improve both detection and monitoring of the progression of the disease. Recently completed long-term clinical trials provide convincing evidence that lowering intraocular pressure prevents progression at both the early and late stages of the disease. The degree of protection is related to the degree to which intraocular pressure is lowered. Improvements in therapy consist of more effective and better-tolerated drugs to lower intraocular pressure, and more effective surgical procedures. New treatments to directly treat and protect the retinal ganglion cells that are damaged in glaucoma are also in development.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the performance of neural networks for perimetric glaucoma diagnosis when using different types of data inputs: numerical threshold sensitivities, Statpac Total Deviation and Pattern Deviation, and probability scores based on Total and Pattern Deviation probability maps (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). METHODS: The results of SITA Standard visual field tests in 213 healthy subjects, 127 patients with glaucoma, 68 patients with concomitant glaucoma and cataract, and 41 patients with cataract only were included. The five different types of input data were entered into five identically designed artificial neural networks. Network thresholds were adjusted for each network. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to display the combinations of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Input data in the form of Pattern Deviation probability scores gave the best results, with an area of 0.988 under the ROC curve, and were significantly better (P {\textless} 0.001) than threshold sensitivities and numerical Total Deviations and Total Deviation probability scores. The second best result was obtained with numerical Pattern Deviations with an area of 0.980. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of type of data input had important effects on the performance of the neural networks in glaucoma diagnosis. Refined input data, based on Pattern Deviations, resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity than did raw threshold values. Neural networks may have high potential in the production of useful clinical tools for the classification of visual field tests.},

Our ANN was a previously described fully trained network using scored pattern deviation probability maps as input data. Its diagnostic accuracy was compared to that of the Glaucoma Hemifield Test, the Pattern Standard Deviation index at the P{\textless}5{\%} and {\textless}1{\%}, and also to a technique based on the recognizing clusters of significantly depressed test points. RESULTS: The included tests had early to moderate visual field loss (median MD=-6.16 dB).

abstract = {Purpose To investigate the risk factors associated with visual field (VF) progression in the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) with pointwise linear regression (PLR) analysis of serial VFs. Design Prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. Participants Five hundred nine eyes of 401 patients from the AGIS with a baseline VF score of ≤16, ≥7 VF examinations, and ≥3 years of follow-up were selected. Main outcome measure Visual field progression. Methods This is a cohort study of patients enrolled in a prospective randomized clinical trial (AGIS). Worsening of a test location on PLR analysis was defined as a change of threshold sensitivity of ≥1.00 decibels a year, with P≤0.01. Visual field progression was defined as worsening of at least 2 test locations within a Glaucoma Hemifield Test cluster with PLR analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk factors associated with VF worsening. Intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuation was defined as standard deviation of the IOP at all visits after the initial surgery. Results The mean (± standard deviation) follow-up time and baseline AGIS score were 7.4 (±1.7) years and 7.7 (±4.4), respectively. Visual field progression was detected with PLR analysis in 151 eyes (30{\%}). Older age at the initial intervention (P = 0.0012; odds ratio [OR], 1.30; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.50), larger IOP fluctuation (P = 0.0013; OR, 1.31; 95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.54), increasing number of glaucoma interventions (P = 0.01; OR, 1.74; 95{\%} CI, 1.14-2.64), and longer follow-up (P = 0.02; OR, 1.19; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.38) were associated with increased odds of VF progression. When regression analyses were repeated in eyes with and without a history of cataract extraction, IOP fluctuation was the only variable to be consistently associated with VF progression. Conclusion Both increasing age and greater IOP fluctuation increase the odds of VF progression by 30{\%} (for each 5-year increment in age and 1-mmHg increase in IOP fluctuation). The higher risk conferred by IOP fluctuation was consistently observed in eyes with and without a history of cataract extraction. {\textcopyright} 2004 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.},

This retrospective study included VF series from 911 eyes of 547 glaucoma patients as test data, and VF series from 5049 eyes of 2858 glaucoma patients as training data. Using training data, variational Bayes linear regression (VBLR) was created to predict VF progression. The performance of VBLR was compared against ordinary least-squares linear regression (OLSLR) by predicting VFs in the test dataset. The total deviation (TD) values of test patients' 11th VFs were predicted using TD values from their second to 10th VFs (VF2-10), the root mean squared error (RMSE) associated with each approach then was calculated. Similarly, mean TD (mTD) of test patients' 11th VFs was predicted using VBLR and OLSLR, and the absolute prediction errors compared.Results. The RMSE resulting from VBLR averaged 3.9 ± 2.1 (SD) and 4.9 ± 2.6 dB for prediction based on the second to 10th VFs (VF2-10) and the second to fourth VFs (VF2-4), respectively. The RMSE resulting from OLSLR was 4.1 ± 2.0 (VF2-10) and 19.9 ± 12.0 (VF2-4) dB. The absolute prediction error (SD) for mTD using VBLR was 1.2 ± 1.3 (VF2-10) and 1.9 ± 2.0 (VF2-4) dB, while the prediction error resulting from OLSLR was 1.2 ± 1.3 (VF2-10) and 6.2 ± 6.6 (VF2-4) dB.Conclusions. The VBLR more accurately predicts future VF progression in glaucoma patients compared to conventional OLSLR, especially in short VF series.},

Clinical judgment may be used to make this assessment, but relatively modest agreement among practitioners supports the use of complementary methods. Event-based analyses take into account expected localized test–retest variabilities in sensitivity, and trend-based analyses are helpful for determining and predicting overall visual function. Landmark clinical trials have used various visual field progression criteria as end points with variable performances. Short- and long-term fluctuations as well as inadequate testing frequency are limitations in visual field analysis for glaucomatous progression. Ongoing improvements in statistical techniques as well as incorporation of functional and structural measures into a single model likely will lead to an enhanced ability to detect glaucomatous progression and will allow for more timely and appropriate therapy.},

While detailed knowledge about these patterns is important to understand the anatomic and genetic aspects of glaucoma, current classification schemes are typically predominantly derived qualitatively. Here, we classify glaucomatous vision loss quantitatively by statistically learning prototypical patterns on the convex hull of the data space. In contrast to component-based approaches, this method emphasizes distinct aspects of the data and provides patterns that are easier to interpret for clinicians. Based on 13 231 reliable Humphrey VFs from a large clinical glaucoma practice, we identify an optimal solution with 17 glaucomatous vision loss prototypes which fit well with previously described qualitative patterns from a large clinical study. We illustrate relations of our patterns to retinal structure by a previously developed mathematical model. In contrast to the qualitative clinical approaches, our results can serve as a framework to quantify the various subtypes of glaucomatous visual field loss. vision lossglaucomaretinal nerve fibre layerReceived October 10, 2014.Accepted November 13, 2014.{\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Base-line mean deviation was not different for nonprogressing vs progressing eyes for all methods (P.05). Pointwise linear regression and GCPA had the highest pairwise concordance (=0.58 [SD, 0.07]). The false prediction rates at 4 and 8 years varied between 1{\%} and 3{\%}. Glaucoma Change Probability Analysis predicted final outcomes better than pointwise linear regression at 4 years (P=.001). Conclusions: All algorithms had low false prediction rates. Glaucoma Change Probability Analysis predicted outcomes better than pointwise linear regression early during follow-up. Algorithms did not perform differently as a function of baseline damage. Pointwise linear regression and GCPA did not agree well regarding spatial distribution of worsening test locations.},

abstract = {Conventionally, glaucoma is diagnosed on the basis of visual field sensitivity (VF). However, the VF test is time-consuming, costly, and noisy. Using retinal thickness (RT) for glaucoma diagnosis is currently desirable. Thus, we propose a new methodology for estimating VF from RT in glaucomatous eyes. The key ideas are to use our new methods of pattern-based regularization (PBR) and pattern-based visualization (PBV) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). PBR effectively conducts supervised learning of RT-VF relations in combination with unsupervised learning from non-paired VF data. We can thereby avoid overfitting of a CNN to small sized data. PBV visualizes functional correspondence between RT and VF with its nonlinearity preserved. We empirically demonstrate with real datasets that a CNN with PBR achieves the highest estimation accuracy to date and that a CNN with PBV is effective for knowledge discovery in an ophthalmological context.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine which machine learning classifier learns best to interpret standard automated perimetry (SAP) and to compare the best of the machine classifiers with the global indices of STATPAC 2 and with experts in glaucoma. METHODS: Multilayer perceptrons (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), mixture of Gaussian (MoG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG) classifiers were trained and tested by cross validation on the numerical plot of absolute sensitivity plus age of 189 normal eyes and 156 glaucomatous eyes, designated as such by the appearance of the optic nerve. The authors compared performance of these classifiers with the global indices of STATPAC, using the area under the ROC curve. Two human experts were judged against the machine classifiers and the global indices by plotting their sensitivity-specificity pairs. RESULTS: MoG had the greatest area under the ROC curve of the machine classifiers. Pattern SD (PSD) and corrected PSD (CPSD) had the largest areas under the curve of the global indices. MoG had significantly greater ROC area than PSD and CPSD. Human experts were not better at classifying visual fields than the machine classifiers or the global indices. CONCLUSIONS: MoG, using the entire visual field and age for input, interpreted SAP better than the global indices of STATPAC. Machine classifiers may augment the global indices of STATPAC.},

abstract = {This study addresses the issue of predicting the glaucomatous visual field loss from patient disease datasets. Our goal is to accurately predict the progress of the disease in individual patients. As very few measurements are available for each patient, it is difficult to produce good predictors for individuals. A recently proposed clustering-based method enhances the power of prediction using patient data with similar spatiotemporal patterns. Each patient is categorized into a cluster of patients, and a predictive model is constructed using all of the data in the class. Predictions are highly dependent on the quality of clustering, but it is difficult to identify the best clustering method. Thus, we propose a method for aggregating cluster-based predictors to obtain better prediction accuracy than from a single cluster-based prediction. Further, the method shows very high performances by hierarchically aggregating experts generated from several cluster-based methods. We use real datasets to demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than conventional clustering-based and patient-wise regression methods, because the hierarchical aggregating strategy has a mechanism whereby good predictors in a small community can thrive.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of machine learning classifiers (MLCs) for glaucoma diagnosis using Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT) and standard automated perimetry (SAP).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Observational cross-sectional study. Sixty two glaucoma patients and 48 healthy individuals were included. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, achromatic standard automated perimetry (SAP) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) imaging with SD-OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, California). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained for all SD-OCT parameters and global indices of SAP. Subsequently, the following MLCs were tested using parameters from the SD-OCT and SAP: Bagging (BAG), Naive-Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Random Forest (RAN), Ensemble Selection (ENS), Classification Tree (CTREE), Ada Boost M1(ADA),Support Vector Machine Linear (SVML) and Support Vector Machine Gaussian (SVMG). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (aROC) obtained for isolated SAP and OCT parameters were compared with MLCs using OCT+SAP data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Combining OCT and SAP data, MLCs' aROCs varied from 0.777(CTREE) to 0.946 (RAN).The best OCT+SAP aROC obtained with RAN (0.946) was significantly larger the best single OCT parameter (p{\textless}0.05), but was not significantly different from the aROC obtained with the best single SAP parameter (p=0.19).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Machine learning classifiers trained on OCT and SAP data can successfully discriminate between healthy and glaucomatous eyes. The combination of OCT and SAP measurements improved the diagnostic accuracy compared with OCT data alone.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method to cluster the spacial patterns of the visual field in glaucoma patients to analyze the progression patterns of glaucoma. The degree of pro- gression in the visual field of glaucoma patients can be di- vided into several regions by straight line boundaries, we call this specific structure Direct Product Structure in this paper. Since we can observe the direct product structure in the visual fields, we propose a bottom-up hierarchical clus- tering method to embed this structure into the clustering structure. In our method, according to the minimum de- scription length (MDL) principle, we select the best cluster division so that the total code length required for encoding the data as well as the clustering structure is minimum. We can thereby select the clusters that are robust to the noise in the position of the direct product structure for clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using an ar- tificial dataset and a real glaucoma dataset. Our proposed method performed better than existing methods for both datasets. For the real glaucoma dataset in particular, our method discovered the characteristic progressive patterns of glaucoma as specific features of clusters. These patternsagree with clinical knowledge. Furthermore, we show that our clusters can be applied to improve the accuracy of pre- dicting glaucoma progression. Thus, our clusters contain rich information of glaucoma, and hence can contribute to further development in glaucoma research.},

abstract = {The study aimed to develop machine learning models that have strong prediction power and interpretability for diagnosis of glaucoma based on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and visual field (VF). We collected various candidate features from the examination of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and visual field (VF). We also developed synthesized features from original features. We then selected the best features proper for classification (diagnosis) through feature evaluation. We used 100 cases of data as a test dataset and 399 cases of data as a training and validation dataset. To develop the glaucoma prediction model, we considered four machine learning algorithms: C5.0, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). We repeatedly composed a learning model using the training dataset and evaluated it by using the validation dataset. Finally, we got the best learning model that produces the highest validation accuracy. We analyzed quality of the models using several measures. The random forest model shows best performance and C5.0, SVM, and KNN models show similar accuracy. In the random forest model, the classification accuracy is 0.98, sensitivity is 0.983, specificity is 0.975, and AUC is 0.979. The developed prediction models show high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC in classifying among glaucoma and healthy eyes. It will be used for predicting glaucoma against unknown examination records. Clinicians may reference the prediction results and be able to make better decisions. We may combine multiple learning models to increase prediction accuracy. The C5.0 model includes decision rules for prediction. It can be used to explain the reasons for specific predictions.;},

abstract = {We consider the prediction of glaucomatous visual field loss based on patient datasets. It is critically important to predict how rapidly the disease is progressing in an individual patient. However, the number of measurements for each patient is so small that a reliable predictor cannot be constructed from the data of a single patient alone. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning approach to this issue. Patient data consist of three features: patient ID, 74-dimensional visual loss values, and inspection time. We reduce the prediction problem into one of matrix completion for these features. Specifically, by assuming heterogeneity in the three features, we introduce similarity measures that reflect the unique statistical nature of the respective features to solve a specific type of matrix decomposition problem. For example, we employ Gaussian kernels as a similarity measure for visual field loss and a linear regression-type relation for the time feature. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method works significantly better than the existing methods. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Glaucoma as a neurodegeneration of the optic nerve is one of the most common causes of blindness. Because revitalization of the degenerated nerve fibers of the optic nerve is impossible early detection of the disease is essential. This can be supported by a robust and automated mass-screening. We propose a novel automated glaucoma detection system that operates on inexpensive to acquire and widely used digital color fundus images. After a glaucoma specific preprocessing, different generic feature types are compressed by an appearance-based dimension reduction technique. Subsequently, a probabilistic two-stage classification scheme combines these features types to extract the novel Glaucoma Risk Index (GRI) that shows a reasonable glaucoma detection performance. On a sample set of 575 fundus images a classification accuracy of 80{\%} has been achieved in a 5-fold cross-validation setup. The GRI gains a competitive area under ROC (AUC) of 88{\%} compared to the established topography-based glaucoma probability score of scanning laser tomography with AUC of 87{\%}. The proposed color fundus image-based GRI achieves a competitive and reliable detection performance on a low-priced modality by the statistical analysis of entire images of the optic nerve head. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},
