\section{Glaucoma}

Glaucoma is a group of progressive optic neuropathies where vision loss results from slow progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons \cite{Yamao2017} [1]. Currently, the pathophysiology of glaucoma is not well understood and there are no models that can robustly characterize glaucoma progression [2]. Glaucoma treatment relies heavily on accurate and timely prediction of the progress of the disease where patients with slowly progressing glaucoma might only require active surveillance, while fast progressors would require intervention. Since glaucoma can eventually cause blindness, an accurate prediction of the progress of the disease will support optimal treatment decisions that are critical for the patientâ€™s quality of life.
