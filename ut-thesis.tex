%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any blank page inserted with
%% \cleardoublepage, use one of \clearemptydoublepage,
%% \clearplaindoublepage, \clearthesisdoublepage, or
%% \clearstandarddoublepage (to use the style currently in effect).
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  - Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal
%%    margins, one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).
%%  - For a rough copy (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced,
%%    with the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use
%%    the `draft' option.
%%  - The default global line spacing can be changed with one of the
%%    options `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.
%%  - Footnotes and marginal notes are all single-spaced by default, but
%%    can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document
%%    by using the option `standardspacednotes'.
%%  - The size of the margins can be changed with one of the options:
%%     . `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4" others),
%%     . `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%%     . `widemargins' (1 1/4" all),
%%     . `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).
%%  - The pagestyle of "cleared" pages (empty pages inserted in
%%    two-sided documents to put the next page on the right-hand side)
%%    can be set with one of the options `cleardoublepagestyleempty',
%%    `cleardoublepagestyleplain', or `cleardoublepagestylestandard'.
%%  - Any other standard option for the `report' document class can be
%%    used to override the default or draft settings (such as `10pt',
%%    `11pt', `12pt'), and standard LaTeX packages can be used to
%%    further customize the layout and/or formatting of the document.

%% *** Add any desired options. ***
\documentclass[onehalfspaced, 12pt, normalmargins]{ut-thesis}

%% *** Add \usepackage declarations here. ***
%% The standard packages `geometry' and `setspace' are already loaded by
%% `ut-thesis' -- see their documentation for details of the features
%% they provide.  In particular, you may use the \geometry command here
%% to adjust the margins if none of the ut-thesis options are suitable
%% (see the `geometry' package for details).  You may also use the
%% \setstretch command to set the line spacing to a value other than
%% single, one-and-a-half, or double spaced (see the `setspace' package
%% for details).

%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}
	
\newcommand{\vf}{\textrm{VF}}
\newcommand{\md}{\textrm{MD}}
\newcommand{\iop}{\textrm{IOP}}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\makecover
\addtocounter{page}{-1}
\maketitle
\addtocounter{page}{-1}

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
%\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
%% *** Put your Abstract here. ***
%% (At most 150 words for M.Sc. or 350 words for Ph.D.)
%%Up to 250 words, single-spaced in block form in centre of separate page.
Glaucoma progression prediction is crucial for making clinical decisions. Visual field testing is one of the most important tools to functionally detect vision loss due to glaucoma. Current standard prediction method (\ac{OLSLR} on \ac{MD}) requires at least 5--6 tested visual fields, or approximately 2 years assuming a semi-annual follow-up interval, to obtain a good estimate of the progression rate. This thesis investigates if \acl{ML} methods can produce better predictions of (1) future \ac{MD} and (2) point-wise field thresholds using the Rotterdam dataset ($N=249$ eyes). All models, including linear models, \ac{CNN}, and \ac{RNN}, performed similarly on this dataset and performed better than \ac{OLSLR}-based extrapolation in terms of \ac{MAE}. However, the performance of these algorithms is similar to simply assuming no change in the field because the dataset consists primarily of stable patients. Future studies should be based on a more comprehensive dataset by including older patients and/or different glaucoma types that are more likely to progress. 

\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed -- just a paragraph
%% formatted flush right (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\begin{dedication}
%% *** Put your Dedication here. ***
%This thesis is dedicated to everyone, and someone, who has come, and maybe gone, but forever has an impact on my life. 
%
%And to my grandfather, who has always believe in me since childhood to become a scholar, and to contributes positively to society. 
%\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% uncomment the following line.
%\newpage  % separate pages for dedication and acknowledgements

%% Alternatively, if you leave both on the same page, it is probably a
%% good idea to add a bit of extra vertical space in between the two --
%% for example, as follows (adjust as desired).
%\vspace{.5in}  % vertical space between dedication and acknowledgements

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
\begin{acknowledgements}
%% *** Put your Acknowledgements here. ***
I would like to acknowledge first and foremost my supervisor Professor Eizenman who has now supervised my work for three years. As I embark on my post-graduate studies and future career, I will never forget the impact of his mentoring on my training to become a researcher. For this specific project, I would like thank my colleagues, especially Yan (Leo) Li, for their support, teaching me various aspects of machine learning, and the thoughtful discussions that we had together. I want to thank all of my friends in the Engineering Science program, without whose support during the difficult times I would not be here today. Last but not least, I want to thank my family for their support in the last five years of my undergraduate studies that have allowed me pursuit my dream of becoming a successful researcher. I will always be grateful for their unreserved support in the past, present, and future of my life.

%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep     %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files.     %%
%%  Each chapter file should start with "\chapter{ChapterName}".      %%
%%  Note that using `\include' instead of `\input' will make each     %%
%%  chapter start on a new page, and allow you to format only parts   %%
%%  of your thesis at a time by using `\includeonly'.                 %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% *** Include chapter files here. ***
